# Snake

A basic replication of the classic snake game that can be ran on the users computer with python using tkinter. The user will download the code and run it with the script below. Then using the arrow buttons on their keyboard they can move the snake around to collect the food pieces. The user can press E if they want to close it down.

What is used: Python and Turtle

To play this game the code would have to be forked or copied. Then run the code with 

`python main.py` (if python3 is aliased on your computer) or `python3 main.py`

*I think it would work on tkinter 8.5 but to not get the warning using whatever distribution method of python you want just make sure it has tkinter updated with it*

**Personal highlights:**
I got to play snake that I made and I felt like I was producing something with functionality that others would use not just a random thing.

**Struggles while building:**
The opening of the high score file was an issue because I didn't realize I needed to convert the data to an integer at first.

**What I learned:**
Opening files within python code. And using with with auto closes the file.
