# Snake

A basic replication of the classic snake game that cane be ran on the users computer with python using tkinter. The user will downlod hte code and run it with the script below. Then using the arrow buttons on their keyboard they can move the snake around to collect the food pieces. 

What is used: Python and Turtle

To play this game the code would have to be forked or copied. Then run the code with 

`python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

*I think it would work on tkinter 8.5 but to not get the warning using whatever distribution method of python you want just make sure it has tkinter updated with it*

**Personal highlights:**
I got to play snake that I made and I felt like I was producing something with functionality that others would use not just a random thing.

**Struggles while building:**
Some of the documentation for turtle I don't believe is very clear so when I was looking for answers it felt like I was missing out on the sceret they had.

**What I learned:**
Working with building a class off a new class, the food class of the game uses Turtle so using `super().__init__()` was a bit interesting. It's nice to be able to reuse code that allows you to modify as needed.
